  ## Description

  this is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site <br>
  where developers can publish their blog posts & comment on other developers’ posts as well <br>
  deployed to Heroku, this app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure <br>
  using Handlebars.js, Sequelize as the ORM & the express-session npm package for authentication

  ## Project Motivation

  ･ an opportunity to apply knowledge of MVC architecture & web development skills in a real-world scenario 
  ･ practiced creating models, views & controllers to handle different aspects of the application
    such as user authentication, publishing blog posts & commenting on posts
  ･ to gain hands-on experience in developing a full-stack application 
    using technologies like Handlebars.js, Sequelize & express-session
  ･ gained understand in the importance of structuring codebase in a modular & scalable manner

  ## What Was Learned

  learned several key concepts & skills related to full-stack application development :

  ･ a deep understanding of the MVC design pattern  <br>
   & how it separates the application into three interconnected components :  <br>
   - the model (data & business logic)  <br>
   - the view (user interface)  <br>
   - & the controller (handles user input and updates the model and view)

  ･ learned how to build the server-side of a web application using frameworks like Express.js  <br>
    including setting up routes, handling HTTP requests & managing server-side logic  <br>

  ･ worked with MySQL  <br>
    learned how to interact using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, Sequelize  <br>
    created models, defined relationships between them  <br> 
    & performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations  <br>

  ･ learned to implement user authentication & authorization features  <br>
    allowing users to register, login & securely access parts of the application  <br> 
    based on permissions

  ･ learned to use Handlebars.js to generate HTML content based on data from the server

  ･ learn how to structure a codebase in a modular & maintainable way  <br>
    following best practices for file organization, code separation & code reusability

  ･ had the opportunity to deploy an application to a hosting platform : Heroku  <br>
    gaining experience in deploying & managing a live web application
